# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview

CNNs are specialized neural networks designed for processing grid-like data such as images.

## Architecture Components

### Convolutional Layers
- Feature extraction through convolution operations
- Parameter sharing and translation invariance

### Pooling Layers
- Dimensionality reduction
- Max pooling vs Average pooling

### Fully Connected Layers
- Final classification or regression

## Popular Architectures

### LeNet
The pioneering CNN architecture for digit recognition.

### AlexNet
Breakthrough architecture that won ImageNet 2012.

### VGG
Very deep networks with small filters.

### ResNet
Residual connections enabling very deep networks.

### DenseNet
Dense connections for efficient parameter usage.
