# Transformer Architecture

## Introduction

Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing and are now being applied to various domains including computer vision.

## Key Components

### Self-Attention Mechanism
The core innovation that allows models to process sequences in parallel.

### Multi-Head Attention
Multiple attention heads capturing different types of relationships.

### Position Encoding
Adding positional information to input embeddings.

### Feed-Forward Networks
Point-wise fully connected layers.

## Variants and Applications

### BERT
Bidirectional encoder representations for language understanding.

### GPT
Generative pre-trained transformers for text generation.

### Vision Transformer (ViT)
Applying transformers to image classification.

### DALL-E
Text-to-image generation using transformers.
