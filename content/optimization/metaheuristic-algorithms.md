# Metaheuristic Algorithms

## Introduction

Metaheuristic algorithms are high-level problem-independent algorithmic frameworks that provide guidelines for developing heuristic optimization algorithms.

## Evolutionary Algorithms

### Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Inspired by natural evolution:

1. **Selection**: Choose parents based on fitness
2. **Crossover**: Combine genetic material
3. **Mutation**: Introduce random changes
4. **Replacement**: Form new population

### Differential Evolution (DE)
Uses vector differences for generating new candidate solutions.

## Swarm Intelligence

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
Simulates social behavior of bird flocking:

```
v_i(t+1) = w*v_i(t) + c1*r1*(pbest_i - x_i(t)) + c2*r2*(gbest - x_i(t))
x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)
```

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
Models foraging behavior of ants using pheromone trails.

## Physics-Inspired Algorithms

### Simulated Annealing (SA)
Based on the annealing process in metallurgy.

### Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA)
Uses Newton's law of universal gravitation.

## Applications
- Engineering design optimization
- Scheduling problems
- Machine learning hyperparameter tuning
- Combinatorial optimization problems
