    Capture a code snippet from a `toml` or `scss` input file. The shortcode scans for named markers in a local file:   
    - For `.toml` files, use `# toml-docs-start` and `# toml-docs-end` followed by the snippet name
    - For `.scss` files, use `// scss-docs-start` and `// scss-docs-end` followed by the snippet name
    
    The snippet between the two markers is then rendered using syntax highlighting.
