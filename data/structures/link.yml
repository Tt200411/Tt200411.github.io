  Generates a link for a given named link or url. The shortcode supports a
  single unnamed parameter, or various named parameters. The unnamed parameter
  is recognized as a url if it starts with `http`, else it is treated as either
  a named link or internal reference (in that order). Any inner text is rendered
  as the link title, otherwise it uses the host name (for external links), link
  title (for internal links), or anchor name (for any local references
  containing a `#`).
