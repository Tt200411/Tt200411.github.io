  Render a local or remote image with responsive image sizing. Images are
  resized using default media breakpoints and are converted to webp format. The
  image is processed using the quality setting specified in the [imaging]
  section of the main config file (defaults to 75). A fallback image is provided
  for older browsers. The image is wrapped in a figure if a caption is provided,
  else the image is wrapped in a div with a ratio constraint.
  
  If the url starts with `http`, the image is retrieved from an external
  location. Else, the url is matched with a page resource and site asset (in
  that order). The path of a remote image is rewritten to ensure processed files
  are stored in the final '/img' folder. 
  
  The partial supports the following bitmap image formats: `png`, `jpeg`, `gif`,
  `tiff`, `bmp`, and  `webp`. Vector graphics of type `svg` are supported too,
  although these images do no support additional processing. This means the
  arguments `ratio` and `portrait` have no effect for vector images. Vector
  graphics support an optional anchor `#` in their url to denote a symbol
  reference.

      Path or url of the image, e.g. `img/example.jpg`. Images with multiple
      color modes are expected to have a basename that ends with either `-dark`
      or `-light`.
