  Generates a markdown table of structured arguments. The argument definitions are
  expected to be defined in a data file identified by a provided structure name.
arguments:
  page:
    optional: false
    group: partial
  structure:
    type: string
    position: 0
    optional: false

      Name of the data file that contains argument definitions. Supported data
      formats include JSON, TOML, YAML, and XML. You can omit the file
      extension. The file should reside in the `data/structures` folder. For
      bookshop components, add the `bookshop-` prefix to the structure name.
  group:
    type: string
    position: 1
    optional: true

      Name of the group filter. This is typically used when a shortcode and
      partial have common arguments. The group filter binds a specific argument
      to a particular group. By default, an argument belongs to all groups.
  parent:
    type: bool
    position: 2
    optional: true
    comment: >-
      Flag to filter only arguments that have a parent attribute (either
      `cascade` or `merge`).
  render-type:
    type: select
    position: 3
    default: both
    optional: true
    comment: >-
      Option whether to render arguments, user-defined types, or both. Please

      case.

        - arguments
        - types
